- Find the issues with the current design.

- Explain why it is bad.

### Getting B:
- Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?

- Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?

- How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?

- How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?

- What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?

- Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.

### Getting A

- Now, imagine that you can have a touch screen on the elevator

- Come with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?

- Design and implement interactive features

- Design and implement user feedback

### Extra credits:

- Your design supports people with disabilities

- You provide extra useful information on the display interface.

- Your imagination ...
